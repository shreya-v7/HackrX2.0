# FEATURES SUGGESTED BY THE JURY AFTER PITCH 3.0

### This video puts forth the following features:

- [x] Implementation of search facet: Users have been provided with a few very commonly searched words in the form of checkboxes. They need not necessarily type out a search query and can just select the checkboxes to make popular searches. However, if required, the search bar and the checkboxes can be used in combination to make the queries.
- [x] Implementation of fuzzy search: As shown in the last query ('child paln'), typos in the search yield results as well. We have implemented the feature to a great extent however there is scope for enhancement in the future.
